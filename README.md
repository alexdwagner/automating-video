# Automating Video

In this workshop we'll use Python and basic command line tools to explore the possibilities of manipulating video with code. We'll treat video as a textual as well as visual medium, and focus on repurposing found footage to generate new compositions and narratives.

## Schedule

### Day 1

* Intro
* A very brief introduction to the command line
